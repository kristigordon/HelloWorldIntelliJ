# HelloWorldIntelliJ
First project working with IntelliJ IDE

Working through Java Documentation to gain a deeper understanding of coding and computer architecture. 

As you can see from my profile, I have expereience with Python but I wanted to dive deeper into archietecture. 
With Jave, I can use a more verbose language to handle things myslef instead of letting Python abstract alot of this learning out for me. 

I am also very interested in mobile developement. Excited to see where this journey takes me.
