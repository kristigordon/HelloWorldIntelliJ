# HelloWorldIntelliJ
First project working with IntelliJ IDE

Working through Java Documentation to gain a deeper understanding of coding and computer architecture. 

I will also be working through 2 texts - The Art of Computer Programming 
https://github.com/manjunath5496/The-Art-of-Computer-Programming-Books/blob/master/aoc(5).pdf

And How Computers Really Work to ensure I am able to take what I learn and put it in context with the computer. 

As you can see from my profile, I have expereience with Python but I wanted to dive deeper into archietecture. 
With Java, I can use a more verbose language to handle things myslef instead of letting Python abstract alot of this learning out for me. 

I am also very interested in mobile developement. Excited to see where this journey takes me.
